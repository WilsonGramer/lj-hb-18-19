### Claim

Lab safety rules are important to have and need to be followed.

### Evidence

 - Lab safety rules ensure that experiments and procedures go as planned and do not unexpectedly harm the student or the sample/subject.
 - Students aware of the lab safety rules will know what to do in the event of an emergency.
 - The lab safety rules are enforced.

### Reasoning

The lab safety rules clearly outline the specific actions and prerequisites that must take place in an experiment, including specific clothing/eyewear requirements; instructions on how to handle materials such as acids, vapors, heated substances, and the like; and directions on how to handle lab equipment like heating devices and biological specimens. In addition, a requirement of the lab safety rules is to know where various safety measures are located in the lab environment, such as the eyewash station, the fire extinguisher, and the fire alarm. Finally, upon signing the lab safety rules a student agrees that violation of the rules will result in a failing grade, a leave of the class, or another disciplinary action.
